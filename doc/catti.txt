                                                                   *catti.nvim*

This plugin that adds cats and joy (non-mutually exclusive) into your already
wonderful neovim experience. 

(There is currently only one main feature! Will be extending with more cat
related features as I get more proficient with lua and neovim.)

For details on the various features, see examples below.


                                                     *catti.ToggleCattiMode()*
ToggleCattiMode()
    
    Toggles CattiMode on and off. 

    During CattiMode, you give some permissions to Catti. One thing Catti
    dislikes is humans who uses the mouse whilst coding. Its nothing to do
    with cats hating mice. Its just elitism. However, Catti is gracious. You
    will be given three chances. Once you hit that number, Catti will run
    |vim.api.nvim_command(":qa!")|. So becareful.
